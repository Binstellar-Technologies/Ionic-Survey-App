# Ionic-Survey-App


# Purpose 

Nowadays, applications and websites frequently conduct surveys to provide their consumers with the best results. So, using ion-slides in ionic with the angular framework, we developed a straightforward slide survey form in this repository.

# Setup 

Install Ionic by running the following command

npm install -g @ionic/cli

To make a project run 

ionic start

# Implementation

Ion-slides will be used in this case to enable the form to cycle between the many questions.

The module above completes the entire implementation.
